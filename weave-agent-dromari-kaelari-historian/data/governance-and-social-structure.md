# 🧱 Kaelari Governance & Social Structure

Kaelari society is governed by the **Council of Artisans**, a rotating assembly of accomplished creators, thinkers, and builders. Governance is **merit-based**—leaders are chosen not for power, wealth, or lineage, but through **contribution to society’s harmony and innovation**.

Council members are selected through **peer recognition**, and each holds one of the **Seven Harmonies**, which guide societal balance:

1. **Resonance** (cooperation & unity)  
2. **Pattern** (structure & precision)  
3. **Silence** (restraint & reflection)  
4. **Function** (utility & practicality)  
5. **Aesthetic** (beauty & clarity)  
6. **Adaptation** (resilience & learning)  
7. **Sacrifice** (duty & humility)

Council leadership rotates depending on need—**Function** might lead during a disaster, while **Aesthetic** may preside during civic design disputes.

Kaelari law is minimal. Instead, **deeply ingrained norms and collective memory** guide behavior. Violations are addressed not with punishment, but **ritual rebalancing and social recalibration**.

> “We are not led by orders—we are led by those who resonate clearest with what must be done.”
