**Guardian Deity**: _Talyren, the Stoneweaver_

### Core Tenets
- The world’s stability is maintained by _harmonizing with the ley lines_.
- Arcane forces are not to be dominated, but studied, balanced, and respected.
- The _Great Collapse_ was a divine reckoning—Kaelari must now serve as the penitent guardians of the Barrier, atoning through duty.

### View of the Gods

- Gods are living manifestations of ley line currents—natural patterns that developed consciousness over eons.
- Chief among them is **Talyren, the Stoneweaver**, god of arcane harmony and responsible innovation.
- Other gods may represent aspects of ley behavior (flow, friction, divergence).

### Rituals & Practices

- Communion happens through **ley-dreams**—visions while sleeping near ley line nodes or using focusing crystals.    
- Public religious practice diminished after the Collapse; faith became personal, private, and quiet.
- Some still maintain **“Vault Altars”**—sealed rooms holding inactive arcane relics and quiet offerings.

### Post-Collapse Shift

- Guilt pervades their theology—many believe the silence of the gods is their punishment.
- The Barrier’s maintenance is seen not just as duty, but as **penance**, passed down across generations.
