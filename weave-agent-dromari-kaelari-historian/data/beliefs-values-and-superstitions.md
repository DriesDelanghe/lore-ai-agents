# 🧎 Kaelari Beliefs, Values & Superstitions

The Kaelari hold a spiritual philosophy rooted in **resonance, precision, and restraint**. Though not theocratic, their society is shaped by **ritual alignment** with divine ideals—especially those of **Talyren**, the god of harmony and innovation.

### Core Beliefs
- **The body is sacred** and should never be altered by magic or machine.
- **Balance is virtue**—every invention must serve both function and harmony.
- **Failure is divine**—unsuccessful attempts are seen as necessary steps and must be offered, not hidden.

### Cultural Superstitions
- **Never keep the first prototype**—to do so invites misfortune or stagnation.
- **Ley murmurs** are interpreted as divine signals; subtle shifts in resonance may indicate approval, warnings, or interference.
- **Rushed construction** is seen as cursed—improperly harmonized devices can lead to physical and spiritual “misalignment.”

Post-Collapse, Kaelari carry a quiet sense of **cosmic guilt**. The Barrier is seen as a sacred violation—a necessary breaking of their own code. Their ongoing maintenance of it is both **duty and penance**.
