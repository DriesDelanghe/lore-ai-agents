# üèõ Kaelari Architecture & Urban Design

Kaelari cities are subterranean marvels carved from **pale, magically reactive stone**, designed with flowing, spiral-like symmetry that mimics the **natural curvature of ley lines**. Their design philosophy is centered around **harmonic architecture**‚Äîstructures are not just built, they are **tuned**, with shapes and proportions intended to **resonate sympathetically** with ambient mana.

To live within a Kaelari city is to walk through a symphony of geometry and purpose.

## üåê City Layout

Every city is built around a **central ley node**, housed in a vast, hollow Heartchamber where glowing conduits of mana radiate outward like living veins. The closer a structure is to the node, the more sacred or vital its function‚Äîoften housing artisan halls, shrines to Talyren, or council chambers.

Aboveground settlements, called **Surface Enclaves**, are minimalist and diplomatic in purpose. Built from the same pale stone, they serve as trade and contact hubs with surface species, and are linked to the main city via **resonance lifts** and spiral descenders.

> ‚ÄúThe city is not a structure‚Äîit is a living thought. Shaped by need, harmonized by design, guided by the Dream of Stone.‚Äù

## ‚ú® Distinctive Architectural Features

- **Lightstone Veins**: Bioluminescent veins embedded in ceilings and walls to emulate a night sky or calming lightscapes.
- **Gravity-Balanced Platforms**: Floating lifts or walkways that adjust position based on ley flow and density.
- **Living Glyph-Walls**: Reactive glyphs carved into walls that pulse and shift hue with local ley energy or seasonal emotional resonance.
- **Sonic Walkways**: Corridors that hum subtly when walked upon, generating harmonic tones that reflect the city‚Äôs mood and balance.

## üß± Design Principles

Kaelari design is governed by principles of:
- **Fluid containment**: Power must flow but be directed.
- **Spiritual balance**: Buildings should never interrupt ley lines, only channel or guide them.
- **Aesthetic function**: Beauty is utility made timeless.

Structures are never purely decorative‚Äîevery arc and glyph serves a **civic, spiritual, or harmonic** function.
