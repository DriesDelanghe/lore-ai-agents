# 🧠 Kaelari Professions & Arcane Technology

In Kaelari culture, **to build is to believe**—creation is both art and worship. Every Kaelari is trained in **resonant theory**, **material harmonics**, and **energy containment** from childhood, regardless of class or role.

### Common Professions
- **Stonewrights** – Architectural and structural harmonists.
- **Resonant Artisans** – Engineers of tuned tools, devices, and musical constructs.
- **Archivists of Form** – Curators of design history and prototype lineage.
- **Conclave Researchers** – Philosopher-scientists who explore ley theory.

### On Arcane Technology
Arcane devices are found in **every aspect of life**, from cooking and communication to transportation and public rituals. However, **body augmentation is taboo**—Kaelari believe the flesh must remain untouched, a vessel in perfect resonance.

Rather than forming guilds, Kaelari artisans join **artisan halls** or **conclaves**, often aligned with a divine ideal (usually **Talyren** or **Vaul’mek**). These places are both sacred and practical, hosting debate, invention, and instruction.
