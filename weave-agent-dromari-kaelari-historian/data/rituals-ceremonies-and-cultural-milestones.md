# 🔔 Kaelari Rituals, Ceremonies & Cultural Milestones

Ritual in Kaelari society is not about appeasement—it is about **resonance**. Ceremonies act as **collective recalibrations**, reattuning individuals and community to the harmonics of purpose, structure, and divinity.

### Major Rites
- **Sync Days**: City-wide harmonization of devices and systems, involving chanting, music, and recalibration of public glyphwork. Marked by communal sharing and reflection.
- **First Invention**: A coming-of-age ritual. The prototype is presented, then **sacrificed to a ley shrine** as a gift to Talyren, never to be replicated.
- **Failure Offering**: Unsuccessful inventions are offered in silence at **Shrines of Imperfection**, symbolic acknowledgements of divine guidance through error.

### Communal Practices
- **Leystone Harmonies**: Public vibration-singing held at shrines to maintain city-wide emotional and spiritual resonance.
- **Forge Circles**: Group creation events centered on collaboration, design feedback, and intergenerational memory-passing.

These ceremonies uphold a **collective humility**, reinforcing that even brilliance must be tempered by remembrance.
