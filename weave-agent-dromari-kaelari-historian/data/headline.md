> “When the last ley line trembled, it was the Kaelari who stood vigil.”

The Kaelari are one of the three subspecies of the Dromari, known in modern myth as the **Burdened Stewards**. Once brilliant subterranean engineers and arcane technologists, the Kaelari were master sculptors of ley lines, shaping energy into function and form. Their society was built around innovation in harmony with nature—crafting cities powered by leyline resonance, forging tools of immense precision, and serving as key architects of the **Great Barrier** that now holds back an otherworldly threat beyond the plane.

Where other species revered magic, the Kaelari **understood** it. This knowledge became their burden. When the world sacrificed its magic to power the Barrier, the Kaelari’s entire technological foundation crumbled overnight. Only the core device—deep underground—remained active, and its maintenance fell to them alone.

Now few in number, the Kaelari dwell in hidden enclaves beneath the surface, keeping the device alive through non-magical innovation. They are **solemn**, **pragmatic**, and haunted by the belief that their pursuit of control over the arcane may have **angered or destroyed their gods**. Their faith, once woven into every tool and vault, has faded into quiet rituals and private guilt.

They are remembered aboveground in fearful reverence—whispered myths speak of them as godlike beings who govern the survival of the world from the depths.

**Core Themes:** Duty as penance, knowledge turned burden, quiet guilt, perseverance in isolation.  
**Guardian Deity:** _Talyren, the Stoneweaver_ – God of arcane harmony and innovation, now silent.  
**Post-Collapse State:** Technologically adaptive survivors, spiritually diminished, culturally reduced to hidden caretakers.
